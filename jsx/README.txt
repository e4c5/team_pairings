on't be mislead by the rather low coverage numbers for the test here.

All off the react components are aggressively tested using selenium and the
django test runner executes them. AFAIK, there isn't a plugin that can 
generate coverage stats for javascript if the test is run through python. If
you come across anything please let me know.
